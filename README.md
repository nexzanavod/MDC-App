## Description
The Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka consists of 28 ministries and
40 state ministries according to the legislation as of today. Each ministry has its own separate website and
a help desk in the office to direct the citizens where necessary. The websites are controlled and updated
by the ministries themselves. Most of the sites provide a hotline which they can use to reach an officer or a
chat service where they can ask questions and direct their problems.

## Features of this application

Through these observations, the group decided to come up with an
idea of creating a new system; a social media application and a website to connect these three spheres of
the system. The researchers decided to create an application like Twitter to fill the gap between these three
layers. The group was able to discuss the specifications of the project and take permission to use the Sri
Lankan logo in the system, thus making it an official project that is affiliated to the government of Sri Lanka
as well.
The system allows the users to create an account for themselves and log in to the app/ site. The user is
then directed to ‘Home’ where the user is able to find information on different ministries. The user can either
choose a particular ministry and check their information or visit multiple and get the information at the same
time. The user is thus able to get all the information on the news, the services, career opportunities, a rating
system that can rate the services and the employees, and the particulars of the officers that is employed in
that particular ministry in one application.
The application contains a messaging system where the users are allowed to exchange messages across
the three layers. There are two parts to this specification.
1. Among users.
2. Among ministries and users.
As mentioned earlier, the system has a rating process as well. This allows the users to react to posts that
are shared in ‘Home’ and they are also allowed to comment on the posts that are shared. Under this rating
system, the users are allowed to rate the employees or the government services officers as well. This will
keep a record on how well they execute their services and if someone is not working as per their job role,
the administration can track that as well.
The next specification of this app is that it contains a ‘Sinhala AI Bot’. The bot was designed by one of our
group members. The bot was trained in Singapore for a period of 6 and a half months, daily. It was fed with
more than 2000 Sinhala and English words per day during the training period. By now, the bot can 
understand words, and thus help users with different tasks. For example, the users can ask different FAQs
and the bot is able to answer them by using the data updated in the system. This allows the users to save
a lot of time spent on different pages.
The system has used the Key method to avoid hackers from hacking the system. The system has used a
key to encrypt data and a key to decrypt data to maximise the security of the system.
We hope, the first phase of the system can be launched by the end of this year.
The particulars of the system, the theories used and the limitations are discussed elaborately in the other
chapters of the project.
